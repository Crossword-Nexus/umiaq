## Features

- **Expressive pattern matching**  
  Match words against patterns with variables, wildcards, and constraints.

- **Variable binding**  
  Use uppercase letters (`A`â€“`Z`) as variables that can bind to substrings and be reused.

- **Wildcards**
  - `.`: any single letter
  - `*`: zero or more letters
  - `@`: any vowel (`AEIOUY`)
  - `#`: any consonant (`BCDFGHJKLMNPQRSTVWXZ`)
  - `[abc]`: any of the listed letters
  - `/abc`: any anagram of the listed letters

- **Constraints**  
  Add conditions on variables or groups of variables:
  - Length: `|A|=3`
  - Inequality: `!=AB` (A must not equal B)
  - Complex: `A=(3-5:a*)` (length 3â€“5, must match pattern `a*`)
  - Joint: `|ABC|=10` (the lengths of A, B, and C sum to 10)

- **Reversed variables**  
  `~A` matches the reverse of variable `A`.

## Examples

- `l.x` â†’ matches words like **LAX**, **LOX**
- `A~A` â†’ palindromes like **NOON**, **REDDER**
- `AB;|A|=2;|B|=2;!=AB` â†’ 4-letters words made up of two concatenated distinct 2-letter substrings
- `A@#A` â†’ words with some string, then a vowel, then a consonant, then the original string again
- `/triangle` â†’ any anagram of "triangle"
- `A;AB;|AB|=7;A=(3-4:g*)` â†’ 7-letter words starting with a 3â€“4 letter word that begins with **g**
