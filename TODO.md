* populate this file (`TODO.md`) with TODOs found in code comments
* organize this file (at least sort... somehow)
* consider adding a struct when faced with long argument lists (for methods) (e.g., recursive_join)
* return `None` vs `Err`
* add progress indicators for long-running operations
* implement parallel processing for large word lists
  * possible concern with web interface?
* add integration tests with real word lists
* "binding" vs. "bindings" in variable names, comments, etc.
